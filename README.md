Been trying to figure out how to get persistent traffic incidents removed from Google Maps. 

2015-02-08: King County metro area incidents are showing up on the PDX metro area maps. 
Specifically, construction reported by WSDOT and accidents near Tacoma/Boeing have been
showing up on Interstate 5 between Vancouver, WA and Portland, OR mapping software. I
first saw this behavior in mid-January 2015.

If you navigate on Google Maps to "133 exit, Tacoma WA" and also to "Portland, OR" you'll 
see that this traffic alert shows up at both locations.
